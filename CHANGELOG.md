# Changelog

- ðŸ”¥ **BREAKING** If you didn't create `GetContentRequest` by spreading default (as in the content example) you must specify the new field `include_unpublished_intents` as well now.
- ðŸ”¥ **BREAKING** The field `GetContentRequest.threshold` is explcitly marked as optional now so it has to be set to `Some(f32)` (or `None`) instead of `f32` now.
- Added `ContentResponseItem.matched_inputs` which counts the number of inputs of the intent that matched.
