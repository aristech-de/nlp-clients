# Aristech NLP-Clients

This repository contains the Natural-Language-Processing client implementations that use [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) to communicate with the [Aristech](https://aristech.de) NLP-Server.

Currently, the following clients are available:

- [NodeJS](node/README.md)
- [Rust](rust/README.md)
- [Python](python/README.md)
- [C#](csharp/README.md)

In order to use the clients, you need to have access to an Aristech NLP-Server. To get credentials for testing, please contact us at [speech@aristech.de](mailto:speech@aristech.de).
